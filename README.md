# Protolib  

Simple C++ 11 library created with an intention to simplify prototyping in C++.  
Library provides following functionality which might come in handy during different phases of C++ development:
* Arguments processing (*ArgsParser.h*)  
* Logging (*Logger.h*)
* LINQ-like container wrapper (*ContainerWrapper.h*)
* PNM images exporter (*PnmExporter.h*)
* SVG images exporter (*SvgExporter.h*)
* Generation of all possible permutations, simplified string parsing, etc. (*Utils.h*)  

All functionality is encapsulated in namespace **protolib**.  
File **main.cpp** contains unit tests and might serve as a good example of how to use different parts of the library.
